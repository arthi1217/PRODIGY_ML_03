# Task 3 – Cats vs Dogs Classification using SVM

## Objective
To classify images of cats and dogs using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model.

## Description
This project implements an image classification system that distinguishes between cats and dogs using supervised machine learning. The model is trained on labeled image data and predicts the class of unseen images.

## Files
-svm_cats_dogs.py – Python script containing the SVM model implementation
-README.md – Project documentation

## Dataset
The dataset consists of images of cats and dogs.
Due to GitHub file upload limitations, the dataset is not included in this repository.

## Input
- Images of cats and dogs

## Output
- Predicted class: Cat or Dog

## Algorithm
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Supervised Learning
